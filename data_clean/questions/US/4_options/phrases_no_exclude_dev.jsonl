{"question": "A 64-year-old man presents to the clinic complaining of low back pain. He was diagnosed with benign prostatic hypertrophy several years ago, which worsened last year. A hard nodule was felt on a digital rectal exam, which led to a prostate biopsy that revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma. A bone scan at that time showed small, focal abnormalities in the lumbar spine. He subsequently underwent radiation therapy to his prostate and pelvic lymph nodes. He was then placed on leuprolide and an anti-androgen. He was doing well until 2 months ago when he developed low back pain, which has worsened since then. He reports that the pain is 8/10 and nearly constant. He states that the pain not only affects his ability to fall asleep but also wakes him up at night. The pain is mildly alleviated by ibuprofen. In addition to prostate cancer, his medical history is significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, recurrent nephrolithiasis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He takes aspirin, lisinopril, rosuvastatin, and pantoprazole. Upon physical examination, there is midline tenderness within the lumbar region.

Although she says that he had been an excellent student in high school, his grades have begun slipping in his second year in college, and he no longer socializes with friends. When she asked him why he no longer talks to his friends, she states that he told her, “They already know where I am. They can see me. They watch me from my bedroom window, so they already know what I’m doing. We don’t need to talk.” She found this to be bizarre, as nearly all of his friends live hours away. The patient states that he feels fine and doesn’t understand why everyone thinks he is crazy.

{"question": "A research group from Europe is investigating a potential link between certain lifestyle risk factors and the development of potentially fatal renal disease. They designed a cohort study that included 68 individuals: 34 exposed and 34 unexposed to given risk factors, who were followed up for 4 years in total. During this time, the renal disease of interest was seen in 6 individuals among the exposed group and 6 individuals among the unexposed group; thus, the risk ratio (RR) of the disease development (exposed vs. unexposed) was 1. During the initial 2 years, there was 1 death in the exposed group, and another death in the unexposed group. A survey administered for the last 2 years of the study showed that the prevalence ratio of disease between exposed and unexposed individuals was in fact 0.5 (at 2 years of follow-up there was only 1 case of the disease in the 34 exposed individuals, with a resulting prevalence of 2.94%; and only 2 cases of the disease in the 34 unexposed individuals, with a resulting prevalence of 5.88%), a value that deviates from the true RR (i.e. 1).

{"question": "A group of researchers is conducting a study to assess the validity and reliability of patient history in determining the amount and duration of drug abuse. In this study, 60 subjects with hepatitis were asked details of their history of drug abuse, such as the duration of drug abstinence, the amount and duration of drug abuse, and the treatment history.

{"question": "A 58-year-old man undergoes coronary angiography that demonstrates a 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The circumflex branch of the left coronary artery is not significantly obstructed. Prior to the angiogram, he underwent a pharmacologic cardiac stress test. When administered, the pharmacologic agent caused the left circumflex artery to vasodilate, with resulting increased blood supply to its supplied myocardium that was already well-perfused at baseline. This increased flow through the circumflex artery shunted blood flow away from the myocardium supplied by the stenosed left anterior descending artery, resulting in ischemia that manifested as a perfusion defect on radionuclide imaging.
