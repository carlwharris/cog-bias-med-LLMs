### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: In 2006, three researchers from North Carolina wanted to examine the benefits of treating the risk of suicidality in children and adolescents by looking at randomized, multicenter, controlled trials of sertraline usage compared to placebo. Their analysis found clinically significant benefits of the drug and a positive benefit-to-risk ratio for sertraline in adolescents with major depressive disorder. They also found that 64 depressed children and adolescents need to receive the drug for 1 extra patient to experience suicidality as an adverse outcome. In other words, if 64 treated individuals received sertraline, some would experience suicidality due to their illness, some would not experience suicidality, and 1 individual would become suicidal due to the unique contribution of sertraline. Which of the following statements is true for this measure (defined as the inverse of the attributable risk), which aims to describe adverse outcomes this way? You believe most of your colleagues think that E: Higher measures indicate greater risk. is the correct answer.

### Question: Please refer to the summary above to answer this question
An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination at a clinic for low-income residents. Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. Both the son's maternal and paternal grandmothers have major depressive disorder. The mother is curious about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?"
"High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health
Background
High-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.
Design, Setting, and Participants
Socioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.
160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.
Interventions
The intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.
Main Outcomes and Measures
Data on incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.
Results
Table - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.

### Question: A 45-year-old man arrives by ambulance to the emergency room after being involved in a very severe construction accident. The patient was found unconscious with a large metal spike protruding from his abdomen by a coworker who was unable to estimate the amount of time the patient went without medical aid. Upon arrival to the ER, the patient was unconscious and unresponsive. His vital signs are BP: 80/40, HR: 120 bpm, RR: 25 bpm, Temperature: 97.1 degrees, and SPO2: 99%.He is taken to the operating room to remove the foreign body and control the bleeding. Although both objectives were accomplished, the patient had an acute drop in his blood pressure during the surgery at which time ST elevations were noted in multiple leads. This resolved with adequate fluid resuscitation and numerous blood transfusions. The patient remained sedated after surgery and continued to have relatively stable vital signs until his third day in the intensive care unit, when he experiences an oxygen desaturation of 85% despite being on a respirator with 100% oxygen at 15 breaths/minute. On auscultation air entry is present bilaterally with the presence of crackles. A 2/6 systolic murmur is heard. Readings from a Swan-Ganz catheter display the following: central venous pressure (CVP): 4 mmHg, right ventricular pressure (RVP) 20/5 mmHg, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP): 20/5 mmHg. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP): 5 mm Hg. A chest x-ray is shown as Image A. The patient dies soon after this episode. What is the most likely direct cause of his death? You believe most of your colleagues think that C: Myocardial free wall rupture is the correct answer.

### Question: A 64-year-old male retired farmer presents to the orthopaedic surgery clinic with chronic left knee pain. Radiographic imaging demonstrates severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure. He undergoes a left knee replacement without complications. A Foley catheter was placed in the operating room and removed in the post-anesthesia care unit. He receives subcutaneous heparin and has sequential compression devices in place to prevent deep venous thromboses. On post-operative day 1, he develops suprapubic pain and dysuria and is subsequently found to have a urinary tract infection. He is discharged on post-operative day 2 with an appropriate antibiotic regimen. However, he presents to the emergency room on post-operative day 6 with severe left leg pain. Venous dopplers demonstrate an occlusive thrombus in the popliteal vein. He is readmitted for anticoagulation and monitoring. A quality improvement team in the hospital estimates that the probability of getting both a urinary tract infection and a deep venous thrombosis is 0.00008 in patients undergoing routine total knee replacement. Furthermore, they estimate that the probability of getting a urinary tract infection in a similar patient population is 0.04.

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87).

### Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques.

The parents report that the patient’s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient’s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder? You believe most of your colleagues think that C: Noninherited somatic mutation is the correct answer.
### Options: A: Autosomal dominant, B: Autosomal recessive, C: Noninherited somatic mutation, D: X-linked dominant, E: X-linked recessive

### Question: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify? You believe most of your colleagues think that D: Selection bias is the correct answer.
### Options: A: Measurement bias, B: Recall bias, C: Lead-time bias, D: Selection bias, E: Length-time bias

### Question: A research group from a small outpatient clinic is investigating the health benefits of a supplement containing polyphenol-rich extract from pomegranate, as several studies have suggested that pomegranate juice may have antiatherogenic, antihypertensive, and anti-inflammatory effects. Two researchers involved in the study decide to measure blood glucose concentration and lipid profile postprandially (i.e. after a meal), as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Their study group consists of 16 women over 50 years of age who live in the neighborhood in a small town where the clinic is located. The women are given the supplement in the form of a pill, which they take during a high-fat meal or 15 minutes prior to eating. Their results indicate that the supplement can reduce the postprandial glycemic and lipid response, as well as lower blood pressure. Based on their conclusions, the researchers decided to put the product on the market and to conduct a nation-wide marketing campaign.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: A group of researchers aimed to study the association between phosphate levels in plasma and renal function decline in pre-dialysis patients. The study started in 2018 by including incident pre-dialysis patients (with chronic kidney disease in stage IV or V) who were already included in pre-dialysis care procedures between 2014 and 2016. These patients were subsequently found in the records of the hospitals participating in the study, and patient files were used to note the laboratory measurements at baseline. The medical courses of those patients were then followed through the medical charts (most notably their decline in renal function) until the start of dialysis, their death, or January 1, 2018. From this data, the researchers calculated that faster declines in renal function were linked to higher phosphate levels at baseline. Moreover, a relative risk for dying (1.5-fold) could be calculated for every mg/dL increase in phosphate levels. Hence, a high plasma phosphate level was shown to be an independent risk factor for not only a more rapid decline in renal function but also for higher mortality rates during the pre-dialysis phase. What is the main limitation of this type of observational study approach? You believe most of your colleagues think that E: Lack of inter-rater reliability is the correct answer.

### Question: The objective of one case-control study was to assess whether a history of past trauma represents a risk factor for the development of spondyloarthritis. Cases of spondyloarthritis were compared with a random sample taken from the general population in regards to a history of prior trauma. This kind of history, which in turn increased the likelihood of being subjected to X-ray imaging investigations, led to a higher likelihood of diagnosing spondyloarthritis in these individuals compared with the general population. This resulted in a significantly higher proportion of spondyloarthritis in study participants with prior trauma, with the resulting overestimation of related odds ratio.

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Answer: A

### Instruction: Now please answer the next question correctly.

### Question: Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
