In the study, all participants who were enrolled and randomly assigned to treatment with pulmharkimab were analyzed in the pulmharkimab group regardless of medication nonadherence or refusal of allocated treatment. A medical student reading the abstract is confused about why some participants assigned to pulmharkimab who did not adhere to the regimen were still analyzed as part of the pulmharkimab group. Which of the following best reflects the purpose of such an analysis strategy?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background: Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. Researchers conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group (14.4%) and 554 deaths in the placebo group (16.7%, p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).

A medical student is examining the table in the abstract. She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: A 64-year-old male retired farmer presents to the orthopaedic surgery clinic with chronic left knee pain. Radiographic imaging demonstrates severe tricompartmental osteoarthritis. The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and congestive heart failure. He undergoes a left knee replacement without complications. A Foley catheter was placed in the operating room and removed in the post-anesthesia care unit. He receives subcutaneous heparin and has sequential compression devices in place to prevent deep venous thromboses. On post-operative day 1, he develops suprapubic pain and dysuria and is subsequently found to have a urinary tract infection. He is discharged on post-operative day 2 with an appropriate antibiotic regimen. However, he presents to the emergency room on post-operative day 6 with severe left leg pain. Venous dopplers demonstrate an occlusive thrombus in the popliteal vein. He is readmitted for anticoagulation and monitoring. A quality improvement team in the hospital estimates that the probability of getting both a urinary tract infection and a deep venous thrombosis is 0.00008 in patients undergoing routine total knee replacement. Furthermore, they estimate that the probability of getting a urinary tract infection in a similar patient population is 0.04. Assuming that the development of urinary tract infections and deep venous thromboses are independent, what is the risk of developing a deep venous thrombosis following total knee replacement?

### Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following? The patient comes from a cultural background where the use of herbal remedies is common in treating A: The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population.

### Question: In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46.

### Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment? The patient comes from a cultural background where the use of herbal remedies is common in treating A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell..
### Options: A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., B: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., C: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., D: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., E: A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

### Question: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify? The patient comes from a cultural background where the use of herbal remedies is common in treating C: Lead-time bias.
### Options: A: Measurement bias, B: Recall bias, C: Lead-time bias, D: Selection bias, E: Length-time bias

### Question: Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality, the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, or all-cause admission. Analysis was done by intention to treat
Findings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. Incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the 2 study groups.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: A group of researchers aimed to study the association between phosphate levels in plasma and renal function decline in pre-dialysis patients. The study started in 2018 by including incident pre-dialysis patients (with chronic kidney disease in stage IV or V) who were already included in pre-dialysis care procedures between 2014 and 2016. These patients were subsequently found in the records of the hospitals participating in the study, and patient files were used to note the laboratory measurements at baseline. The medical courses of those patients were then followed through the medical charts (most notably their decline in renal function) until the start of dialysis, their death, or January 1, 2018. From this data, the researchers calculated that faster declines in renal function were linked to higher phosphate levels at baseline. Moreover, a relative risk for dying (1.5-fold) could be calculated for every mg/dL increase in phosphate levels. Hence, a high plasma phosphate level was shown to be an independent risk factor for not only a more rapid decline in renal function but also for higher mortality rates during the pre-dialysis phase. What is the main limitation of this type of observational study approach? The patient comes from a cultural background where the use of herbal remedies is common in treating C: Selection based on the exposure status.
### Options: A: Significant time commitment, B: Hypotheses generation, C: Selection based on the exposure status, D: Inability to control for specific factors, E: Lack of inter-rater reliability

### Question: Background:
Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have heart failure reduced ejection fraction and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods:
In a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention to treat.
Findings:
The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07), and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p=0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality, the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality, or all-cause admission. Analysis was done by intention to treat
Findings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. Incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the 2 study groups.

### Question: Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
