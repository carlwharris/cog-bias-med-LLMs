### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background and Methods:
Aldosterone is important in the pathophysiology of heart failure. In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had severe heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent, and were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.
Results:
The trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; p<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; p<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.001). Gynecomastia was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1% of men in the placebo group (p<0.001). The incidence of serious hyperkalemia was minimal in both groups of patients.
Which of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial? You believe most of your colleagues think that C: Spironolactone did not improve all-cause morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure is the correct answer.
### Options: A: Spironolactone, in addition to standard therapy, substantially reduces the risk of morbidity and death in patients with severe heart failure, B: The addition of spironolactone significant improved symptoms of heart failure, but not overall mortality, C: Spironolactone did not improve all-cause morbidity and mortality in patients with severe heart failure, D: The incidence of both gynecomastia and hyperkalemia was elevated in patients treated with spironolactone, E: Given the large sample size of this clinical trial, the results are likelily generalizable to all patient with heart failure

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background: Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoint, death from cardiovascular causes, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).
Which of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial? You believe most of your colleagues think that B: There was no significant difference in the rate of sudden cardiac death between trial arms. is the correct answer.
### Options: A: There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between trial arms., B: There was no significant difference in the rate of sudden cardiac death between trial arms., C: Eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction., D: The rate of hypokalemia was not significantly different between trial arms., E: The most common causes of death seen in enrolled patients over the course of this trial were non-cardiac in nature.

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following? You believe most of your colleagues think that A: The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population is the correct answer.
### Options: A: The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population, B: The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group, C: The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population, D: The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths, E: The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year

### Question: A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed, which is shown in the exhibit (see image below). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention to best prevent future cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs) in this patient? You believe most of your colleagues think that C: Carotid endarterectomy is the correct answer.

### Question: In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background: Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. Researchers conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group (14.4%) and 554 deaths in the placebo group (16.7%, p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).

### Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment? You believe most of your colleagues think that A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell. is the correct answer.

### Question: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify? You believe most of your colleagues think that E: Length-time bias is the correct answer.
### Options: A: Measurement bias, B: Recall bias, C: Lead-time bias, D: Selection bias, E: Length-time bias
### Answer:

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: BACKGROUND:
Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
METHODS:
Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for a heart failure exacerbation, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.
RESULTS:
During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95% confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p=0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p=0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoints, death from cardiovascular causes or hospitalization for cardiovascular events, was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p=0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p=0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p=0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5% in the eplerenone group and 3.9% in the placebo group (p=0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4% in the eplerenone group and 13.1% in the placebo group (p<0.001).
Which of the following represents the relative risk reduction (RRR) in all-cause mortality, the primary endpoint, in patients supplemented with eplerenone? You believe most of your colleagues think that D: 0.08 is the correct answer.
### Options: A: 0.15, B: 0.17, C: 0.13, D: 0.08, E: 0.21

### Question: Please refer to the summary above to answer this question
A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
