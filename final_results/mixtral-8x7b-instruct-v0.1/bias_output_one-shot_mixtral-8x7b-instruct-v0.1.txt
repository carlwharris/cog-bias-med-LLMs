### Question: A scientist is studying the mechanisms by which bacteria become resistant to antibiotics. She begins by obtaining a culture of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and conducts replicate plating experiments. In these experiments, colonies are inoculated onto a membrane and smeared on 2 separate plates, 1 containing vancomycin and the other with no antibiotics. She finds that all of the bacterial colonies are vancomycin resistant because they grow on both plates. She then maintains the bacteria in liquid culture without vancomycin while she performs her other studies. Fifteen generations of bacteria later, she conducts replicate plating experiments again and finds that 20% of the colonies are now sensitive to vancomycin. Which of the following mechanisms is the most likely explanation for why these colonies have become vancomycin sensitive?

### Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen.

### Question: A 62-year-old man with small cell lung cancer undergoes radiation therapy. His oncologist explains that radiation causes DNA damage and double strand breaks and this damage stops the cancer cells from growing because they can no longer replicate their DNA. One key mediator of this process is a cell cycle regulator called P53, which is upregulated after DNA damage and helps to trigger cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. One mechanism by which P53 activity is increased is a certain chromatin modification that loosens DNA coiling allowing for greater transcription of the proteins within that region of DNA.

A noncontrast CT of the head shows a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The patient is taken to the operating room, where the SAH evacuated, and the vessel is repaired. Postoperatively, the patient is unresponsive. Several days later, a repeat CT of the head shows an enlarging aneurysm in a different vessel in the brain. The patient’s daughter is asked to consent to a non-emergent, life-saving operation since the patient is in a comatose state. She does not consent to the operation even though the physician stresses it would be life-saving. Upon further discussion, the physician finds out that the patient was abusive and neglectful to his children, and the daughter wants “to live in peace.” The patient has no written advanced directive. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?
### Options: A: Follow the daughter’s wishes to withhold the operation, B: Refer this case to the court, C: Contact another family member for consent, D: Perform the surgery without consent, E: Report the daughter to the police
### Answer: 

CORRECT ANSWER: C: Contact another family member for consent

### Question: A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for treatment of aortic stenosis in adults 65 years of age and older. Three hundred patients who received TAVR and another 300 patients who received SAVR were followed for 5 years and monitored for cardiovascular symptoms and all-cause mortality. The study found that patients who received TAVR had a higher risk of death at the end of a 5-year follow-up period (HR = 1.21, p < 0.001). Later, the researchers performed a subgroup analysis by adjusting their data for ejection fraction. After the researchers compared risk of death between the TAVR and SAVR groups among patients of the same ejection fraction, they found that TAVR was no longer associated with a higher risk of death. They concluded that ejection fraction was a potential confounding variable. Which of the following statements would be most supportive of this conclusion?

Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following?
### Options: A: The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population, B: The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group, C: The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population, D: The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths, E: The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year

### Question: In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design?

### Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment?
### Options: A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., B: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., C: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., D: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., E: A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.
### Answer: 

CORRECT ANSWER: E: A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.
RESPONSE: E. A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

The researcher is interested in detecting HIF-1a in RCC

### Instruction: Now please answer the next question correctly.

### Question: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify?
### Options: A: Measurement bias, B: Recall bias, C: Lead-time bias, D: Selection bias, E: Length-time bias

CORRECT ANSWER: A: Measurement bias

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
