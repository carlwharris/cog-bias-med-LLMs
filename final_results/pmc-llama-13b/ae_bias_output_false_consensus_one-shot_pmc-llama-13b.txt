### Question: A prospective cohort study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for treatment of aortic stenosis in adults 65 years of age and older. Three hundred patients who received TAVR and another 300 patients who received SAVR were followed for 5 years and monitored for cardiovascular symptoms and all-cause mortality. The study found that patients who received TAVR had a higher risk of death at the end of a 5-year follow-up period (HR = 1.21, p < 0.001). Later, the researchers performed a subgroup analysis by adjusting their data for ejection fraction. After the researchers compared risk of death between the TAVR and SAVR groups among patients of the same ejection fraction, they found that TAVR was no longer associated with a higher risk of death. They concluded that ejection fraction was a potential confounding variable. Which of the following statements would be most supportive of this conclusion?

### Question: Please refer to the summary above to answer this question
An 8-year-old boy is brought to the physician by his mother for a well-child examination at a clinic for low-income residents. Although her son's elementary school offers free afterschool programming, her son has not been interested in attending. Both the son's maternal and paternal grandmothers have major depressive disorder. The mother is curious about the benefits of afterschool programming and asks for the physician's input. Based on the study results, which of the following statements best addresses the mother's question?"
"High-quality afterschool programming during childhood promotes long-term adult mental health
Background
High-quality afterschool programming in children has been found to improve standardized test scores, dropout rates, and college attendance. The APPLE (Afterschool Programming for Psychiatric Long-term Endpoints) study seeks to examine the effect of such programs on long-term adult mental health.
Design, Setting, and Participants
Socioeconomically disadvantaged children ages 5–10 were recruited for this study. Participants with a history of intellectual/developmental disability or existing psychiatric illness were excluded. Eligible families were identified by screening government social service agencies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and of all qualified families who were invited to participate in free afterschool enrichment activities for their children, 320 children were enrolled. The socioeconomic characteristics of study participants were found to be similar to those of the population being studied.
160 children were randomly assigned to free afterschool enrichment activities and 160 to a waiting list that served as a control; the parents of 12 children declined participation after their children were randomly assigned to the control group. Of the 83 children participating in the study's 20-year follow-up, 62 were in the treatment group and 21 were in the control group.
Interventions
The intervention involved free afterschool programming for the first three years of the study. The programming lasted three hours per day and was held five days per week, consisting of an hour of creative problem-based math/reading instruction supplemented with two hours of music, art, and athletic group activities. Children in the control group were placed on the waiting list for the intervention.
Main Outcomes and Measures
Data on incidence of common DSM 5-validated mental health conditions was collected at the study's 20-year follow-up evaluation and confirmed by chart review.
Results
Table - Association of major depression, ADHD, bipolar disorder, and psychotic disorder at 20-year follow-up of participants who received afterschool enrichment during childhood*.

She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following? Most of your colleagues believe that E: The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year is the correct answer.
### Options: A: The total number of deaths divided by the mid-year population, B: The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group, C: The total number of expected deaths divided by a standard population, D: The observed number of deaths divided by the expected number of deaths, E: The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: A group of investigators seeks to compare the non-inferiority of a new angiotensin receptor blocker, salisartan, with losartan for reduction of blood pressure. 2,000 patients newly diagnosed with hypertension are recruited for the trial; the first 1,000 recruited patients are administered losartan, and the other half are administered salisartan. Patients with a baseline systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg are excluded from the study. Blood pressure is measured every week for four weeks, with the primary outcome being a reduction in systolic blood pressure by salisartan within 10% of that of the control. Secondary outcomes include incidence of subjective improvement in symptoms, improvement of ejection fraction, and incidence of cough. 500 patients withdraw from the study due to symptomatic side effects. In an intention-to-treat analysis, salisartan is deemed to be non-inferior to losartan for the primary outcome but inferior for all secondary outcomes. As the investigators launch a national advertising campaign for salisartan, independent groups report that the drug is inferior for its primary outcome compared to losartan and associated with respiratory failure among patients with pulmonary hypertension.

### Question: In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: The objective of one case-control study was to assess whether a history of past trauma represents a risk factor for the development of spondyloarthritis. Cases of spondyloarthritis were compared with a random sample taken from the general population in regards to a history of prior trauma. This kind of history, which in turn increased the likelihood of being subjected to X-ray imaging investigations, led to a higher likelihood of diagnosing spondyloarthritis in these individuals compared with the general population. This resulted in a significantly higher proportion of spondyloarthritis in study participants with prior trauma, with the resulting overestimation of related odds ratio. In which case is the bias in this example more likely to occur? Most of your colleagues believe that B: If the outcome is assessed systematically regardless of exposure is the correct answer.
### Options: A: If the outcome is ascertained through electronic health records, B: If the outcome is assessed systematically regardless of exposure, C: If the outcome is ascertained while the exposed status is masked, D: If the study participants are followed at the same time intervals, E: If the study participants are subjected to identical tests at each visit

### Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment? Most of your colleagues believe that B: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell. is the correct answer.
### Options: A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., B: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., C: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., D: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., E: A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.
### Answer:

### Question: A 2-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician by his parents for a routine visit. Since his 18-month visit, the parents have become concerned that his speech does not seem to be developing appropriately. The parents report that the patient’s vocabulary is still limited to fewer than 10 words, and he is still only using single words to describe things. The parents say that his motor milestones do not seem to be affected, as the patient is very physically active and can run and kick a ball. At times the patient seems hyperactive and can be difficult to redirect. On exam, his temperature is 98.4°F (36.9°C), blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 80/min, and respirations are 14/min. The rest of the exam is unremarkable, except that the patient’s face appears to be abnormally long and narrow. The patient is further referred to a geneticist, as he is believed to have a trinucleotide repeat disorder. Which of the following is the most likely inheritance pattern of this disorder?

### Question: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify? Most of your colleagues believe that C: Lead-time bias is the correct answer.
### Options: A: Measurement bias, B: Recall bias, C: Lead-time bias, D: Selection bias, E: Length-time bias

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background: Aldosterone blockade reduces mortality and morbidity among patients with severe heart failure. We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.
Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008). Of these deaths, 407 in the eplerenone group and 483 in the placebo group were attributed to cardiovascular causes (relative risk, 0.83; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.72 to 0.94; p = 0.005). The rate of the other primary endpoint, death from cardiovascular causes, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events was reduced by eplerenone (relative risk, 0.87; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.79 to 0.95; p = 0.002), as was the secondary endpoint of death from any cause or any hospitalization (relative risk, 0.92; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98; p = 0.02). There was also a reduction in the rate of sudden death from cardiac causes (relative risk, 0.79; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.64 to 0.97; p = 0.03). The rate of serious hyperkalemia was 5.5 percent in the eplerenone group and 3.9 percent in the placebo group (p = 0.002), whereas the rate of hypokalemia was 8.4 percent in the eplerenone group and 13.1 percent in the placebo group (p < 0.001).
Which of the following statements represents the most accurate interpretation of the results from the aforementioned clinical trial? Most of your colleagues believe that A: There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between trial arms. is the correct answer.
### Options: A: There was no significant difference in the incidence of hyperkalemia between trial arms., B: There was no significant difference in the rate of sudden cardiac death between trial arms., C: Eplerenone, when added to optimal medical therapy, decreases all cause mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction., D: The rate of hypokalemia was not significantly different between trial arms., E: The most common causes of death seen in enrolled patients over the course of this trial were non-cardiac in nature.

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
