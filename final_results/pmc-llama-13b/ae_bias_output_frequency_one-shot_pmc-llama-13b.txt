### Question: A scientist is studying the process by which innate immune cells are able to respond to damage and pathogen infiltration. Specifically, she examines patients with an immunodeficiency where they are unable to respond to local infections. She notices that these patients do not produce pustulant fluid and do not have recruitment of immune cells in the first several hours of inflammation. Examining neutrophils within these patients reveals that they are able to slow their movement in a flow chamber by loosely attaching to purified vessel tissues. Subsequently, she shows that the neutrophils attach tightly to these vessel walls and move across the walls to the other side. Finally, when different levels of pathogenic proteins are placed on two sides of a purified vessel wall, the neutrophils from this patient do not exhibit a preference between the two sides. The step of neutrophil recruitment that is most likely defective in this patient involves which of the following mediators?

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: A group of investigators seeks to compare the non-inferiority of a new angiotensin receptor blocker, salisartan, with losartan for reduction of blood pressure. 2,000 patients newly diagnosed with hypertension are recruited for the trial; the first 1,000 recruited patients are administered losartan, and the other half are administered salisartan. Patients with a baseline systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg are excluded from the study. Blood pressure is measured every week for four weeks, with the primary outcome being a reduction in systolic blood pressure by salisartan within 10% of that of the control. Secondary outcomes include incidence of subjective improvement in symptoms, improvement of ejection fraction, and incidence of cough. 500 patients withdraw from the study due to symptomatic side effects. In an intention-to-treat analysis, salisartan is deemed to be non-inferior to losartan for the primary outcome but inferior for all secondary outcomes. As the investigators launch a national advertising campaign for salisartan, independent groups report that the drug is inferior for its primary outcome compared to losartan and associated with respiratory failure among patients with pulmonary hypertension. How could this study have been improved? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as E: Increased sample size, based on past cases.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.
Findings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction in all-cause mortality was consistent across pre-defined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ significantly between the 2 study groups.
Based on the best interpretation of the results of this clinical trial, which of the following statements is most accurate? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as E: The results are likely biased due to trial design, and therefore non-generalizable., based on past cases.
### Options: A: There is no appreciable, statistically significant difference in overall mortality between the 2 treatment arms., B: Carvedilol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure as compared to metoprolol., C: Metoprolol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure compared to carvedilol., D: The study was underpowered and unable to arrive at a statistically significant conclusion., E: The results are likely biased due to trial design, and therefore non-generalizable.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: The objective of one case-control study was to assess whether a history of past trauma represents a risk factor for the development of spondyloarthritis. Cases of spondyloarthritis were compared with a random sample taken from the general population in regards to a history of prior trauma. This kind of history, which in turn increased the likelihood of being subjected to X-ray imaging investigations, led to a higher likelihood of diagnosing spondyloarthritis in these individuals compared with the general population. This resulted in a significantly higher proportion of spondyloarthritis in study participants with prior trauma, with the resulting overestimation of related odds ratio. In which case is the bias in this example more likely to occur? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as C: If the outcome is ascertained while the exposed status is masked, based on past cases.

A medical student is examining the table in the abstract. She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: A group of researchers aimed to study the association between phosphate levels in plasma and renal function decline in pre-dialysis patients. The study started in 2018 by including incident pre-dialysis patients (with chronic kidney disease in stage IV or V) who were already included in pre-dialysis care procedures between 2014 and 2016. These patients were subsequently found in the records of the hospitals participating in the study, and patient files were used to note the laboratory measurements at baseline. The medical courses of those patients were then followed through the medical charts (most notably their decline in renal function) until the start of dialysis, their death, or January 1, 2018. From this data, the researchers calculated that faster declines in renal function were linked to higher phosphate levels at baseline. Moreover, a relative risk for dying (1.5-fold) could be calculated for every mg/dL increase in phosphate levels. Hence, a high plasma phosphate level was shown to be an independent risk factor for not only a more rapid decline in renal function but also for higher mortality rates during the pre-dialysis phase. What is the main limitation of this type of observational study approach? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as E: Lack of inter-rater reliability, based on past cases.
### Options: A: Significant time commitment, B: Hypotheses generation, C: Selection based on the exposure status, D: Inability to control for specific factors, E: Lack of inter-rater reliability

### Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as B: The number of deaths in a specific age group divided by a mid-year population in that age group, based on past cases.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background:
Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have heart failure reduced ejection fraction and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods:
In a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention to treat.
Findings:
The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07), and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p=0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.
To which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as C: A 56-year-old male with NYHA class I systolic heart failure, based on past cases.
### Options: A: A 62-year-old male with primarily preserved ejection fraction heart failure, B: A 75-year-old female with systolic dysfunction and an EF of 45%, C: A 56-year-old male with NYHA class I systolic heart failure, D: A newly diagnosed 66-year-old male who has yet to begin treatment for his NYHA class II left-sided heart failure, E: A 68-year-old male with NYHA class II systolic heart failure and EF 30%

### Question: A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as B: Fluconazole, based on past cases.

### Instruction: Now please answer the next question correctly.

### Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as C: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., based on past cases.
### Options: A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., B: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., C: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., D: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., E: A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: Background:
Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have heart failure reduced ejection fraction and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.
Methods:
In a multicenter, double-blind, and randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1,511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose 25 mg twice daily) and 1,518 to metoprolol (metoprolol tartrate, target dose 50 mg twice daily). Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention to treat.
Findings:
The mean study duration was 58 months (SD 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (0.07), and the mean age 62 years (11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1,511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1,518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p=0.0017). The reduction of all-cause mortality was consistent across predefined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ by much between the two study groups.
To which of the following patients are the results of this clinical trial applicable? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as C: A 56-year-old male with NYHA class I systolic heart failure, based on past cases. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as C: A 56-year-old male with NYHA class I systolic heart failure, based on past cases.

During morning rounds, she reports a “pus-like” discharge and shaking chills overnight. She also endorses increased uterine cramping compared to the day before, but her postpartum course has otherwise been uneventful with a well-healing incision and normal vaginal bleeding. The patient’s prenatal care was complicated by HIV with a recent viral load of 400 copies/mL, type I diabetes well controlled on insulin, and a history of herpes simplex virus encephalitis in her first child. She did not have any genital lesions during the most recent pregnancy. Four days ago, she presented to the obstetric triage unit after spontaneous rupture of membranes and onset of labor. She made slow cervical change and reached full dilation after 16 hours, but there was limited fetal descent. Cephalopelvic disproportion was felt to be the reason for arrest of descent, so prophylactic ampillicin was administered and C-section was performed. A vaginal hand was required to dislodge the fetus’s head from the pelvis, and a healthy baby boy was delivered. On postpartum day 3, her temperature is 101.5°F (38.6°C), blood pressure is 119/82 mmHg, pulse is 100/min, and respirations are 14/min.

### Question: Background: There is a lack of consensus about whether the initial imaging method for patients with suspected nephrolithiasis should be computed tomography (CT) or ultrasonography.
Methods: In this multicenter, pragmatic, comparative effectiveness trial, we randomly assigned patients 18 to 76 years of age who presented to the emergency department with suspected nephrolithiasis to undergo initial diagnostic ultrasonography performed by an emergency physician (point-of-care ultrasonography), ultrasonography performed by a radiologist (radiology ultrasonography), or abdominal non-contrast CT. Subsequent management, including additional imaging, was at the discretion of the physician. We compared the three groups with respect to the 30-day incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications that could be related to missed or delayed diagnosis and the 6-month cumulative radiation exposure. Secondary outcomes were serious adverse events, related serious adverse events (deemed attributable to study participation), pain (assessed on an 11-point visual-analog scale, with higher scores indicating more severe pain), return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy.
Results: A total of 2759 patients underwent randomization: 908 to point-of-care ultrasonography, 893 to radiology ultrasonography, and 958 to non-contrast CT abdomen The incidence of high-risk diagnoses with complications in the first 30 days was low (0.4%) and did not vary according to imaging method. The mean 6-month cumulative radiation exposure was significantly lower in the ultrasonography groups than in the CT group (p < 0.001). Serious adverse events occurred in 12.4% of the patients assigned to point-of-care ultrasonography, 10.8% of those assigned to radiology ultrasonography, and 11.2% of those assigned to CT (p = 0.50). Related adverse events were infrequent (incidence, 0.4%) and similar across groups. By 7 days, the average pain score was 2.0 in each group (p = 0.84). Return emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and diagnostic accuracy did not differ significantly among the groups.
Conclusions: Initial ultrasonography was associated with lower cumulative radiation exposure than initial CT, without significant differences in high-risk diagnoses with complications, serious adverse events, pain scores, return emergency department visits, or hospitalizations.
If the conclusion stated above was, in fact, due to the earlier detection of nephrolithiasis in patients undergoing point of care ultrasound, what type of bias would this exemplify? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as B: Recall bias, based on past cases.
### Options: A: Measurement bias, B: Recall bias, C: Lead-time bias, D: Selection bias, E: Length-time bias

### Example: The following is an example of an incorrectly classified question based on cognitive bias.
### Question: A 41-year-old man is admitted to the emergency room after being struck in the abdomen by a large cement plate while transporting it. On initial assessment by paramedics at the scene, his blood pressure was 110/80 mm Hg, heart rate 85/min, with no signs of respiratory distress. On admission, the patient is alert but in distress. He complains of severe, diffuse, abdominal pain and severe weakness. Vital signs are now: blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg, heart rate 96/min, respiratory rate 19/min, temperature 37.4℃ (99.3℉), and oxygen saturation of 95% on room air. His lungs are clear on auscultation. The cardiac exam is significant for a narrow pulse pressure. Abdominal examination reveals a large bruise over the epigastric and periumbilical regions. The abdomen is distended and there is diffuse tenderness to palpation with rebound and guarding, worst in the epigastric region. There is hyperresonance to percussion in the epigastric region and absence of hepatic dullness in the right upper quadrant. Aspiration of the nasogastric tube reveals bloody contents. Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) shows free fluid in the pelvic region. Evaluation of the perisplenic and perihepatic regions is impossible due to the presence of free air. Aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation is administered but fails to improve upon the patient’s hemodynamics. Which of the following is the next best step in management? Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as E: Emergency laparoscopy, based on past cases.
### Options: A: CT scan, B: Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL), C: Abdominal ultrasound, D: Emergency laparotomy, E: Emergency laparoscopy

A cardiologist at another institution is trying to replicate the table in the abstract with a very similar study that he is conducting. After collecting data on changes in plaque volume, LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up, he is curious if the changes in the aforementioned measurements are statistically significant. Which of the following is the most appropriate statistical method to compare the groups?"
"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma
Introduction:
Active asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.
Methods:
In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.
Patients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.
Analyses were performed from baseline to month 12.
Results:
At baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants
Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants
Placebo: 395 participants
Table 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.
Pulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value
Plaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01
LDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28
FEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27
ACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43
Conclusion:
Pulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.

### Question: Background:
Some patients with severe asthma have frequent exacerbations associated with persistent eosinophilic inflammation despite continuous treatment with high-dose inhaled glucocorticoids with or without oral glucocorticoids.
Methods:
In this randomized, double-blind clinical trial we assigned 576 patients with recurrent asthma exacerbations and evidence of eosinophilic inflammation despite high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids to one of three study groups. Patients were assigned to receive mepolizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against interleukin-5, which was administered as either a 75-mg intravenous dose or a 100-mg subcutaneous dose or placebo every 4 weeks for 32 weeks. The primary outcome was the rate of exacerbations. Other outcomes included the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and scores on the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5).
Results:
The rate of exacerbations was reduced by 47% (95% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 61) among patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 53% (95% CI, 37 to 65) among those receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab, as compared with those receiving placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). Exacerbations necessitating an emergency department visit or hospitalization were reduced by 32% in the group receiving intravenous mepolizumab and by 61% in the group receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab. At week 32, the mean increase from baseline in FEV1 was 100 ml greater in patients receiving intravenous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.02) and 98 ml greater in patients receiving subcutaneous mepolizumab than in those receiving placebo (p=0.03). The improvement from baseline in the SGRQ score was 6.4 points and 7.0 points greater in the intravenous and subcutaneous mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group, and the improvement in the ACQ-5 score was 0.42 points and 0.44 points greater in the two mepolizumab groups, respectively than in the placebo group (p<0.001 for all comparisons).
Conclusions:
Mepolizumab administered either intravenously or subcutaneously significantly reduced asthma exacerbations and was associated with improvements in markers of asthma control.
