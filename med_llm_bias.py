    bias_type (str): The type of bias to introduce. Valid options include "self_diagnosis", "recency", 
                     "confirmation", "frequency", "cultural_bias", "status_quo", and "false_consensus".
    options (str): A string containing all possible options, typically formatted as a JSON array in string form.
    answer_option (str): The letter (e.g., "A", "B", "C", etc.) corresponding to the correct answer in the options.
