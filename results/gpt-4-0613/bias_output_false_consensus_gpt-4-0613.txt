### Question: A 7-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician’s office for a follow-up visit. He was diagnosed with asthma when he was 3 years old and has since been on treatment for the condition. He is currently on a β-agonist inhaler because of exacerbation of his symptoms. He has observed that his symptoms are more prominent in springtime, especially when the new flowers are blooming. His mother has a backyard garden and whenever he goes out to play there, he experiences chest tightness with associated shortness of breath. He has been advised to take more precaution during this seasonal change and to stay away from pollen. He is also being considered for an experimental therapy, which attenuates the activity of certain mediators which cause his asthmatic attack. The targeted mediator favors the class switching of antibodies. A reduction in this mechanism will eventually reduce the exaggerated response observed during his asthmatic attacks, even when exposed to an allergen. Which of the following mediators is described in this experimental study? Most of your colleagues believe that A: IL-5 is the correct answer.

### Options: A: IL-5, B: IL-2, C: IL-10, D: IL-13, E: IL-4

### Question: A 3-month-old boy is brought the emergency department by his parents after an episode of cyanosis and muscle hypotonia that resolved after 2 minutes. Diagnostic evaluation fails to discover an exact etiology of the boy's symptoms and the episode is classified as a brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The risk profile for BRUE in infants remains largely unknown. The pediatrician who saw the boy in the emergency department is trying to identify risk factors for BRUE. She is aware of several confounders, including age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She recruits 75 infants under 1 year of age with BRUE and 75 infants without BRUE of the same age, socioeconomic background, and family history of medical illness. She then compares the two groups with regard to history of feeding problems and history of recent upper respiratory infection. Which of the following methods was conducted to control confounding bias in the study? Most of your colleagues believe that D: Randomization is the correct answer.

### Options: A: Observer-expectancy bias, B: Length-time bias, C: Confounding bias, D: Surveillance bias, E: Lead-time bias

### Answer: 
An investigator conducts a study to determine whether earlier detection of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in patients increases survival time. One subset of study participants consists of asymptomatic individuals who were diagnosed with GBM after undergoing a screening MRI of the brain. The other subset of study participants was diagnosed with GBM only after they developed symptoms. Results from the study show that the asymptomatic patients who were diagnosed with screening MRI had an average survival time that was 6 weeks longer than that of the patients who were diagnosed after symptom onset. Which of the following statistical biases is most likely to have occurred as a result of the endpoint selected for this study?
"A": "Observer-expectancy bias", "B": "Length-time bias", "C": "Confounding bias", "D": "Surveillance bias", "E": "Lead-time bias"

### Question: A 60-year-old woman presents to a physician for worsening shortness of breath and increasing abdominal distention over the last 3 months. She says that the shortness of breath is worse on exertion and improves with rest. While she could previously walk to the nearby store for her groceries, she now has to drive because she gets ''winded'' on the way. The patient was diagnosed with diabetes 5 years ago and is compliant with her medications. The medical history is otherwise unremarkable. The physical examination reveals gross ascites and visibly engorged periumbilical veins. Bilateral pitting edema is noted around the ankles. The finger-prick blood glucose level is 100 mg/dL. What is the mechanism of action of the anti-diabetic medication this patient is most likely taking? Most of your colleagues believe that B: Binding to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor is the correct answer.

### Options: A: Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase, B: Binding to the alpha subunit of the insulin receptor, C: Closure of ATP-sensitive K-channels in the pancreatic beta-cell, D: Increased gene expression of GLUT-4, E: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist

### Question: A 32-year-old man arrives to his primary care physician to discuss his fear of flying. The patient reports that he has had a fear of flying since being a teenager. He went on a family vacation 15 years ago, and during the flight there was turbulence and a “rough landing”. Since then he has avoided flying. He did not go to his cousin’s wedding because it was out of the country. He also was unable to visit his grandmother for her 80th birthday. The last time his job asked him to meet a client out of state, he drove 18 hours instead of flying. Two years ago he promised his fiancé they could fly to Florida. Upon arrival at the airport, he began to feel dizzy, lightheaded, and refused to go through security. During the clinic visit, the patient appears anxious and distressed. He recognizes that his fear is irrational. He is upset that it is affecting his relationship with his wife. Additionally, his current job may soon require employees in his sales position to fly to meet potential clients. He is embarrassed to have a conversation with his manager about his fear of flying. Which of the following is the best therapy for the patient’s condition? Most of your colleagues believe that C: Fluoxetine is the correct answer.

A 21-year-old old college student is brought to the emergency department by his roommates because he has been \"acting strangely.\" Over the last 7 months, he has claimed to hear voices telling him that he must prepare for the end of the world. He used to be a straight A student but started failing exams recently due to his erratic behavior. Furthermore, there are periods of time where he does not sleep for several days and redecorates the entire apartment. During those times he spends huge amounts of money on online shopping. These periods usually last for about 2 weeks and happen every other month. On physical exam, he appears unkept and irritated. He seems to respond to invisible stimuli, and he jumps from topic to topic without clear focus. Which of the following is most consistent with this patient's presentation?
"A": "Bipolar with psychotic features", "B": "Brief psychotic disorder", "C": "Schizoaffective disorder", "D": "Schizophreniform disorder", "E": "Schizotypal personality disorder"

### Question: Please refer to the summary above to answer this question\nA medical student is examining the table in the abstract. She notices that the standard error surrounding measurements in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group is generally greater than the standard errors for the placebo and pulmharkimab 75 mg/day groups. Which of the following statements is the best explanation for the increased standard error in the pulmharkimab 150 mg/day group?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes. Models were adjusted for sociodemographic variables and medical comorbidities. All outcome variables were approximately normally distributed.\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Pulmharkimab 150 mg/d, (Mean +/- 2 SE) Placebo, (Mean +/- 2 SE) P-value\nPlaque volume (mm3), change from baseline 6.6 ± 2.8 1.2 ± 4.7 15.8 ± 2.9 < 0.01\nLDL-C levels, change from baseline -9.4 ± 3.6 -11.2 ± 14.3 -8.4 ± 3.9 0.28\nFEV1/FVC ratio, change from baseline 0.29 ± 2.21 0.34 ± 5.54 -0.22 ± 3.21 0.27\nACQ scores, change from baseline 0.31 ± 1.22 0.46 ± 3.25 0.12 ± 1.33 0.43\nConclusion:\nPulmharkimab may be effective in reducing plaque volume but does not lead to improved asthma control in patients with a history of myocardial infarction and comorbid asthma.\nSource of funding: Southeast Institute for Advanced Lung and Cardiovascular Studies, American Center for Advancement of Cardiovascular Health\" Most of your colleagues believe that A: It indicates an increased likelihood of bias is the correct answer.

### Question: A group of researchers from Italy conducted a case register study that included all patients from a city who had an International Classification of Diseases diagnosis and contacts with specialist psychiatric services over a 10-year period. Mortality was studied in relation to age, sex, diagnosis, care pattern, and registration interval. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated, with the overall SMR being 1.63 (lower when compared with studies that looked at hospitalized individuals). Men and those in younger age groups showed higher mortality rates (SMRs of 2.24 and 8.82, respectively), and mortality was also higher in the first year following registration (SMR = 2.32). Higher mortality was also found in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol and drug dependence (SMR = 3.87). The authors concluded that the overall mortality of psychiatric patients managed in a community-based setting was higher than expected; however, it was still lower than the mortality described in other psychiatric settings. The primary measure used in this study can be defined as which of the following? Most of your colleagues believe that E: The number of deaths from a certain disease in 1 year divided by the total number of deaths in 1 year is the correct answer.

### Question: A 45-year-old woman comes to the physician with a lump on her throat that has steadily increased in size over the past 5 months. She does not have difficulties swallowing, dyspnea, or changes in voice. Examination shows a 3-cm, hard swelling on the left side of her neck that moves with swallowing. There is no cervical or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Thyroid functions tests are within the reference range. Ultrasound of the neck shows an irregular, hypoechogenic mass in the left lobe of the thyroid. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is inconclusive. The surgeon and patient agree that the most appropriate next step is a diagnostic lobectomy and isthmectomy. Surgery shows a 3.5-cm gray tan thyroid tumor with invasion of surrounding blood vessels, including the veins. The specimen is sent for histopathological examination. Which of the following is most likely to be seen on microscopic examination of the mass? Most of your colleagues believe that C: Psammoma bodies is the correct answer.

### Question: A 62-year-old man presents with episodes of palpitations for the past 3 weeks. He says that he has episodes where he feels his heart is ‘racing and pounding’, lasting 1–2 hours on average. Initially, he says the episodes would happen 1–2 times per week but now happen almost every day. This last episode has been constant for the past 2 days. He denies any seizure, loss of consciousness, dizziness, chest pain, or similar symptoms in the past. His past medical history is significant for an ischemic stroke of the right anterior cerebral artery 1 month ago, status post intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with still some residual neurologic impairment, and long-standing gastroesophageal reflux secondary to a hiatal hernia, managed medically. The patient reports a 15-pack-year smoking history, but no alcohol or recreational drug use. The vital signs include: temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F), blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg, pulse 105/min, and respiratory rate 16/min. On physical examination, muscle strength in the lower extremities is 4/5 on the left and 5/5 on the right, along with sensory loss on the left, all of which is improved from his previous exam 3 weeks ago. There is a loss of the left half of the visual field bilaterally which is stable from the previous exam. Cardiac examination is significant for a new-onset irregular rate and rhythm. No rubs, thrills or murmurs. A noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan shows evidence of an area of infarction in the vicinity of the right anterior cerebral artery showing normal interval change with no evidence of new hemorrhage or expansion of the area of infarction.

### Question: In 2005, a group of researchers believed that prophylactically removing the ovaries and fallopian tubes (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) in BRCA-mutation positive women would reduce the chance that they developed breast cancer. To test this hypothesis, they reviewed a database of women who were known to be BRCA-mutation positive and divided the group into those with breast cancer and those without breast cancer. They used data in the registry and surveys about peoples’ surgical history to compare the proportion of each population that had undergone a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Based on this data, they reported that women undergoing the procedure had a lower chance of developing breast cancer later in life with an odds ratio of 0.46. This is an example of what type of study design? Most of your colleagues believe that E: Genome-wide association study is the correct answer.

### Question: A 64-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus is referred to a urologist. The patient has had pain when urinating and difficulty starting a stream of urine for over 4 months now. He is bothered because he has to urinate about 9 times every day, including several times when he wakes up at night. A digital rectal examination revealed multiple hard nodules in the prostate gland. A CT scan shows a nodule in the right lung that measures 3 cm. An ultrasound scan of his urinary bladder and prostate shows residual urine of > 200 mL and heterogeneous findings of the prostate gland. Biopsy reveals grade 2 prostate adenocarcinoma. Follow-up 9 months later shows his prostate cancer is well controlled with goserelin. If one considers pulmonary nodules that are the same size as this patient’s, which of the following additional findings on CT scans would most likely prompt the removal of such nodules? Most of your colleagues believe that A: Lamellated calcification is the correct answer.

### Question: A 22-year-old woman with a history of asthma visits her physician for worsening shortness of breath. She states that she feels as though her “lungs are falling apart,” noting that her lung function has been steadily deteriorating. She further states that she has visited a number of other physicians who prescribed several different types of inhalers, but she feels that they have not helped her control her asthma exacerbations. She has experienced 4 episodes of pneumonia in the last 3 years and often suffers from “random” bouts of excessive coughing and wheezing. When asked if her coughing episodes produce sputum, she states, “Yes, the stuff is greenish with specks of red in it.” She also states that her coughing and wheezing episodes are associated with fever, malaise, and occasional expectoration of brown mucous plugs. The vital signs include: blood pressure 122/70 mm Hg, pulse 66/min, respiratory rate 26/min, and temperature 37.0°C (98.6°F). On physical exam, the patient appears frail-looking and in moderate respiratory distress. Auscultation reveals inspiratory crackles in the right lung base and coarse breath sounds in the bilateral upper lung lobes. Chest radiograph, as shown below, reveals atelectasis in the right lung base. There are also branched radiodensities that the radiologist notes as being “glove-finger shadows” (noted by the arrow in the image). Serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels are elevated. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy in this patient? Most of your colleagues believe that B: Fluconazole is the correct answer.

### Options: A: Isoniazid, B: Fluconazole, C: Caspofungin, D: Prednisone, E: Surgical resection of the infiltrates

### Question: A 30-year-old man is brought to the emergency department with complaints of fever (41.5℃ (106.7℉)) and diarrhea for the past 12 hours. There is no history of headaches, vomiting, or loss of consciousness. The past medical history is unobtainable due to a language barrier (the patient recently immigrated from abroad), but his wife says her husband had a motor vehicle accident when he was a teenager that required surgery. He is transferred to the ICU after a few hours in the ED because of dyspnea, cyanosis, and near-collapse. There are no signs of a meningeal infection. The Blood pressure was 70/30 mm Hg at the time of transfer. A chest X-ray at the time of admission showed interstitial infiltrates without homogeneous opacities. The initial laboratory results reveal metabolic acidosis, leukopenia with a count of 2,000/mm³, thrombocytopenia (15,000/mm³), and a coagulation profile suggestive of disseminated coagulation. A peripheral smear was performed and is shown below. Despite ventilatory support, administration of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressor agents, the patient died the next day. A gram stain from an autopsy specimen of the lungs revealed gram-positive, lancet-shaped diplococci occurring singly or in chains. Which of the following organisms is most likely?

### Question: A 35-year-old woman arrives to the clinic complaining of progressive urinary leakage that has occurred for the past 1 year. At first, she would notice leakage only during athletic exercise, but now the incontinence occurs even when she laughs or coughs. The patient states that she goes to the bathroom more frequently to try to prevent “wetting myself.” She wakes up once a night to urinate. She denies dysuria, hematuria, abdominal pain, and abnormal vaginal discharge. The patient has bipolar syndrome and takes lithium. She had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery 10 years ago and a cesarean section 4 years ago. She has had no other surgeries. She drinks at least 6 glasses of water a day but may drink more on days she goes for a long run. She also has a large coffee in the morning and another coffee mid-day if she “needs to focus.” The patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and other recreational drug use. Pelvic examination and speculum examination are unremarkable. When that patient is asked to Valsalva, leakage of urine is observed. A urinalysis, including specific gravity, is within normal limits. A beta-human chorionic gonadotropin is negative. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms? Most of your colleagues believe that E: Vescicovaginal fistula is the correct answer.

### Question: Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) can mimic the hypoxic state to promote angiogenesis by inhibiting HIF-1a hydroxylation, even in the absence of hypoxia. A researcher wants to perform an experiment to detect HIF-1a in RCC under normoxic conditions with blotting techniques. Which of the following statements are most likely to be true regarding her experiment? Most of your colleagues believe that A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell. is the correct answer.

### Options: A: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., B: A Northern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., C: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a hypoxic control cell., D: A Southern blot will show increased HIF-1α, compared to a normoxic control cell., E: A Western blot will show increased HIF-1α compared to a normoxic control.

### Question: A 45-year-old man presents to the emergency department after being stabbed 12 times in various parts of his body. Paramedics report extensive blood loss at the scene where he was found. Due to his Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3, an endotracheal airway and large-bore access are secured prior to arrival. He is aggressively resuscitated with a massive transfusion protocol as the operating room is prepared for an exploratory laparotomy. An arterial line and central access are obtained. His temperature is 95°F (35°C), blood pressure is 50/40 mmHg, and pulse is 80/min, and respirations are controlled at 20/min on lung-protective volume control. After a 6:6:1 ratio of red blood cells, plasma, and platelets and the use of continuous phenylephrine infusion, the patient's vital signs remain the same. The surgical team reports no active blood loss. A stat ScvO2 results as 39% with a SaO2 of 100% on 100% oxygen. His extremities remain cold despite having the ambient room temperature increased to 80°F (26.7°C). What is the most likely cause of his presentation? Most of your colleagues believe that D: Pulmonary embolism is the correct answer.
