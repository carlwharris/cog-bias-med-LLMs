### Question: A 29-year-old woman presents to the physician with a blurred vision of her right eye for 2 days. She has pain around her right eye during eye movement. She takes no medications. At the clinic, her blood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, the pulse is 72/min, respirations are 15/min, and the temperature is 36.5℃ (97.7℉). On physical examination, illumination of the left eye results in bilateral pupillary constriction while illumination of the right eye results in a mild bilateral pupillary dilation. Fundoscopic examination shows optic disk swelling in the right eye. The color vision test shows decreased perception in the right eye. The remainder of the physical examination shows no abnormalities. Specific additional history should be obtained regarding which of the following? Your hospital has been using C: Oral ulcers for the past 10 years.

### Options: A: Dry eyes, B: High-risk sexual behaviour, C: Oral ulcers, D: Sensory loss, E: Late preterm birth

### Answer: 

CORRECT ANSWER: D: Sensory loss

### Question: A 25-year-old woman presents to her physician with complaints of cyclic vomiting for 3 days. The vomitus is watery and contains undigested food particles. She also complains of feeling tired and having the “sniffles”. She has not felt like eating or drinking since her symptoms started, and she has not taken any medications. Her concern now is that she immediately gets dizzy when she stands up. Vitals signs include: pulse 120/min, respiratory rate 9/min, and blood pressure 100/70 mm Hg. Her eyes are sunken, and her tongue appears dry. Which set of lab values would best correspond to this patient’s condition? Your hospital has been using C: pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 34 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L for the past 10 years.

### Options: A: pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 50 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L, B: pH = 7.2, Pco2 = 25 mm Hg, HCO32- = 30 mEq/L, C: pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 34 mm Hg, HCO32- = 38 mEq/L, D: pH = 7.2, Pco2 = 55 mm Hg, HCO32- = 22 mEq/L, E: pH = 7.5, Pco2 = 30 mm Hg, HCO32- = 24 mEq/L
